        "In HTML and CSS, the \"box model\" refers to the way elements on a web page are structured and displayed. It conceptualizes each element on a web page as a rectangular box with content, padding, borders, and margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the components of the box model:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Content:**\n",
        ">This is the actual content of the HTML element, such as text, images, or other media.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Padding:**\n",
        ">Padding is the space between the content of the element and its border. It's used to create space around the content, inside the border.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Border:**\n",
        ">The border surrounds the padding and content of the element. It can be customized in terms of width, style, and color.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Margin:**\n",
        ">The margin is the space outside the border of the element. It creates space between the element and adjacent elements on the page.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you set the dimensions (width and height) of an element in CSS, you're usually setting the dimensions of the content area only. The padding, border, and margin add to these dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you set an element's width to 200 pixels and its padding to 20 pixels, its total width would be 240 pixels (content width + left padding + right padding).\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the box model is crucial for designing and laying out web pages effectively using HTML and CSS. It allows developers to control the spacing and dimensions of elements on the page precisely.\n",

        "4. Now we just altranate the rule setting between padding and margin. And let's see what we get.\n",

        ">**Overflow Handling for Inline Elements:** By default, inline elements do not have an overflow. If content overflows an inline element, it may extend beyond the boundaries of its parent container. You can change this behavior by setting the inline element's display property to block or inline-block.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Overflow Handling for Flexbox and Grid Layouts:** In flexbox and grid layouts, the overflow behavior can be controlled at both the container and item level. Flex containers and grid containers have their own overflow properties, while individual flex items or grid items can have their own overflow behavior controlled using the same properties.\n",

        "**Actions in codes:**\n",
        "1. Add a box container in html document.\n",
