        <h2>What is styling font in html and css?</h2>
        <p>
          Styling fonts in HTML and CSS allows web designers to enhance the
          visual appeal and readability of text content on web pages. With CSS,
          various properties can be applied to control the appearance of fonts,
          such as font family, size, weight, style, and color. Fonts can be
          selected from a wide range of options, including web-safe fonts and
          custom fonts imported from external sources. Additionally, CSS
          provides flexibility in adjusting spacing, alignment, and decoration
          of text. Techniques like text shadow and text transformation further
          enable designers to create unique and engaging typography effects. By
          leveraging CSS, designers can achieve cohesive branding, improve user
          experience, and convey desired messages effectively through visually
          appealing text styles. With the versatility of CSS, the possibilities
          for font styling are endless, empowering designers to create visually
          stunning and engaging web content.
