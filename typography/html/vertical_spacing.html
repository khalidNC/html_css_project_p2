        <h2>Vertical Spacing</h2>
        <p>
          Vertical spacing in HTML and CSS documents serves the purpose of
          enhancing readability and visual appeal by creating consistent and
          balanced spacing between lines of text. By controlling the distance
          between lines, known as line height or leading, designers can improve
          legibility and optimize the user experience. In CSS, vertical spacing
          can be adjusted using the line-height property, allowing for precise
          control over the spacing between lines of text. Additionally, margins
          and padding can be applied to elements to further control vertical
          spacing, ensuring a harmonious layout and improving the overall
          aesthetics of the content.

        <h2>Law of proximity</h2>
        <p>
          The law of proximity, a fundamental principle in design, states that
          objects that are close to each other are perceived as belonging
          together. Applying the law of proximity means arranging text elements
          with appropriate vertical spacing to visually group related content.
          By adjusting the spacing between paragraphs, headings, and other text
          elements, designers can create a clear hierarchy and improve
          readability. Consistent vertical spacing helps users navigate the
          content more easily, enhancing the overall user experience. Utilizing
          CSS properties such as margin and padding, designers can control the
          vertical spacing between text elements to effectively apply the law of
          proximity and create visually cohesive layouts.
