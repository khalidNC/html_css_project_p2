        <h2>The importance of sizing fonts.</h2>
        <p>
          When sizing fonts in HTML and CSS documents, it's essential to
          consider factors such as readability, accessibility, and visual
          aesthetics to ensure a positive user experience. Font sizing can be
          specified using various units, including pixels (px), percentages (%),
          ems (em), rems (rem), and viewport units (vw, vh). Using relative
          units like ems, rems, percentages, and viewport units allows for
          scalable and flexible font sizes that adapt to different screen sizes
          and user preferences. Additionally, it's crucial to maintain a
          harmonious hierarchy of font sizes across different elements such as
          headings, paragraphs, and links to create a visually pleasing and
          well-structured layout. Remember to test font sizes across different
          devices and screen resolutions to ensure readability and usability for
          all users.
