          A system font stack in HTML and CSS refers to a set of font families
          that are commonly available across different operating systems. It's a
          fallback mechanism used to ensure that text content on a webpage is
          displayed consistently, regardless of the user's device or browser
          settings. The system font stack typically includes generic font
          families such as sans-serif, serif, and monospace, as well as specific
          system fonts like Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, and Courier New.
          By defining a system font stack in CSS, web developers prioritize
          using fonts that are native to the user's device, reducing the need to
          load custom fonts from external sources. This improves page load times
          and enhances the overall user experience. Additionally, system font
          stacks provide a level of consistency and accessibility, ensuring that
          text remains readable and legible across various platforms and screen
          sizes.
