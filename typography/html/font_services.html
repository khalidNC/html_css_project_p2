      <h2>Impact of web font service</h2>
      <p>
        Web font services play a crucial role in web design by providing a vast
        selection of fonts that can be easily integrated into HTML and CSS
        documents. These services offer a wide range of typefaces, including
        popular fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and Times New Roman, as well as
        more unique and modern options. With web font services, web designers
        can enhance the visual appeal of their websites and create a more
        engaging user experience. These services typically operate on a
        subscription-based model, offering various plans to accommodate the
        needs of different projects and budgets. Additionally, web font services
        often provide tools and resources to help designers choose the right
        fonts for their projects and optimize font loading performance for
        improved website speed and usability.

      <p>
        One of the key benefits of using web font services is the ease of
        implementation. By simply including a link or script tag in the HTML
        document's head section, designers can access a vast library of fonts
        hosted on the service's servers. This eliminates the need to manually
        download and install font files on the server, saving time and
        simplifying the font management process. Furthermore, web font services
        often offer advanced features such as font subsetting and optimization,
        allowing designers to customize fonts to meet specific project
        requirements while minimizing file size and load times. Overall, web
        font services provide a convenient and efficient solution for
        integrating custom fonts into HTML and CSS documents, empowering
        designers to create visually stunning and distinctive websites.
