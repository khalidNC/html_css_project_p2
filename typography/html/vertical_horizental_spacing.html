        <h2>Vertical Spacing</h2>
        <p>
          Vertical spacing in HTML and CSS documents serves the purpose of
          enhancing readability and visual appeal by creating consistent and
          balanced spacing between lines of text. By controlling the distance
          between lines, known as line height or leading, designers can improve
          legibility and optimize the user experience. In CSS, vertical spacing
          can be adjusted using the line-height property, allowing for precise
          control over the spacing between lines of text. Additionally, margins
          and padding can be applied to elements to further control vertical
          spacing, ensuring a harmonious layout and improving the overall
          aesthetics of the content.

        <h2>Law of proximity</h2>
        <p>
          The law of proximity, a fundamental principle in design, states that
          objects that are close to each other are perceived as belonging
          together. Applying the law of proximity means arranging text elements
          with appropriate vertical spacing to visually group related content.
          By adjusting the spacing between paragraphs, headings, and other text
          elements, designers can create a clear hierarchy and improve
          readability. Consistent vertical spacing helps users navigate the
          content more easily, enhancing the overall user experience. Utilizing
          CSS properties such as margin and padding, designers can control the
          vertical spacing between text elements to effectively apply the law of
          proximity and create visually cohesive layouts.

        <h2 class="last-two-heading">Horizental spacing</h2>
        <p>
          Horizontal spacing inside text in HTML and CSS documents serves the
          purpose of enhancing readability and improving visual appeal. By
          adjusting the spacing between characters, words, and lines, designers
          can create a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout. In HTML,
          horizontal spacing can be achieved using CSS properties such as
          letter-spacing to control the space between characters, word-spacing
          to adjust the space between words, and line-height to control the
          spacing between lines of text. These properties allow designers to
          fine-tune the spacing to suit the design requirements and improve the
          overall legibility of the text.
        </p>
        <h2 class="last-two-heading">Importance of horizental spacing</h2>
        <p>
          Additionally, horizontal spacing can be used to create visual
          hierarchy and emphasize certain elements within the text. By
          strategically adjusting the spacing around headings, paragraphs, and
          other text elements, designers can draw attention to important
          information and guide the reader's eye through the content more
          effectively. Proper horizontal spacing not only enhances the visual
          appeal of the text but also contributes to a better user experience by
          making the content easier to read and understand.
